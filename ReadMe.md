## Description:
The deck is dedicated for *[Anki][7]* users who are interested in learning Hawaiian language. It is based on a completely free Hawaiian course on *Duolingo* (see [this article][1] for more information).

For now I incorporate audio files in an .mp3 format (128kbs; maybe I will change it to a little bit lower quality over time).


## Installation
1. On Your PC download and install ([from this site][7]) the *Anki* app (*Windows*, *GNU/Linux* or *Mac*).
2. Download the newest version of the “Golden Thoughts” deck (the *Hawaiian Anki.apkg* file [from this page][6])
3. Launch *Anki* and choose from the menu: *File ➜ Import...* .
4. Locate the downloaded file (*Hawaiian Anki.apkg*), select it and click the “Open” button. The deck should be imported.
5. If You want, You can install *Anki* also on Your smartphone and then login and synchronize with the desktop app.


## Updates.
I’m going to update this deck alongside my progress with Hawaiian course on *Duolingo* mentioned before.

The newest version You’ll always find on [this *GitHub* page][6b].
